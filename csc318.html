                     set out to teach students the UX/UI design process from the ground up. 
                     From user research to prototyping, this course aimed to give students the tools 
                     to design interactive media that is both user-friendly and visually appealing.

                My group decided to attempt to tackle the issue of FOMO, creating a social media app 
                that focused on appreciating common everyday moments.

                    <li>Researched the phenomena of FOMO such that we would have a more concrete understanding of the phenomenon</li>
                    <li>Created job stories to represent users who experience FOMO: 
                        <ul class="text-sm">

                                to me, I want to attend that event so I can have

                                with that event so that I can feel better about 
                                my own experiences and not feel left out.”</i></li>

                                event, I want to instead think about the important 
                                reasons that I didn't attend so that I don't 
                                feel as bad about missing out.”</i></li>

                                I need to consider how other parties feel and 
                                their availability so that they don't feel 
                                excluded thus putting a strain on our 
                                relationship.”</i></li>

                                social events, I need to consider which event 
                                interests me more and who is going there so 
                                that I can get a more meaningful experience 
                                from the event.”</i></li>
