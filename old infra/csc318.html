                    set out to teach students the UX/UI design process from the
                    ground up. From user research to prototyping, this course
                    aimed to give students the tools to design interactive media
                    that is both user-friendly and visually appealing.

                    My group decided to attempt to tackle the issue of FOMO,
                    creating a social media app that focused on appreciating
                    common everyday moments.
